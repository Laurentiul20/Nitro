The nitrogen game:
Under Watershed tab, selection is Whole, Sub Watersheds, and Past Hypoxic Zones
Under Weather tab, selection is Wet Year, Medium, Dry Year
Under Crop Price Index, selection is Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High
Under Watershed tab, Whole: 2 sliders controlling Fertilizer Recution(%) and Wetland Restoration(% area)
Fertilizer Recution reduces hypoxic zone, nitrate entering watershed, and nitrates to gulf in thousand of tones, but increases spendings $ billion(from 0 to 10) , and crop yield reduction (%)
Wetland Restoration reduces hypoxic zone, nitrates to gulf in thousand of tones, but increases spendings $ billion(from 0 to 10) decintrification, and crop yield reduction (%)
Weather and crop price just speeds up or slows down the same process.
Sub Watersheds explore separate regions of Missouri, Upper Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas Red-White, and Lower Mississippi
Each zone has 2 sliders as in Watershed tab
Past Hypoxic Zones represents the past years hypoxic zone from 1985 to 2009, you can visually compare them in km2 to the Mississippi Watershed map
